	<h4>Signs VS <b>Web Design</b></h4>
	<p>well, here you go. maybe you have reached this page out of curiosity or maybe you are attempting to call my bluff--either way I totally assure you that the two are related.</p>
	<p>Steve Krug explained the correlation several times in "Don't Make Me Think" as he talks about the fact that the best user experiences have practically invisible design. If the user thinks for a long time, often they leave frustrated or confused. And that's where my signage background is involved. We see signs every day and even use them but do we ever pay attention to their design? not usually, unless you have worked in the sign industry.</p>
	<p>Some important things the signage industry has taught me: <br>
	-design with intention (is there a reason you chose that font?) <br>
	-design for the average (or below average user--can your cousin, Jimmy with 6 toes and 2 teeth understand what's going on?)<br>
	-elicit client feedback<br>
	-understand conventions, where to use them and why (this heps to control what the user expects versus what is designed)</p>
	 
	 <p>have I made a believer of you? if not, I'm happy to talk in more detail...buy me coffee or something and I'll chat your ear off. </p>
